->Database
All dictionaries are saved in a Database class hashmap, in which the key is represented by
the dictionary language, and the value is a list of dictionaries. I extracted the language of the
dictionary from the names of the json files.

->Tests
I created a test class, in which we initialized the database before each test. For each method, I performed 1-2 tests
for standard cases and 1 test for special cases.
In the tests folder I have some json files that helped me read the inputs for some tests. For example, to test the
method that adds a word to the dictionary, the first 2 files contain new words, which are added without problems,
and the third test file contains a word that is already in the dictionary, but has new definitions. , so the method
is updated and returns true.

For the method that adds definitions, the first test must return false, because the word already contains that
definition, and in the second case, the new definition is successfully added.

For the method of exporting json files, we performed a test in which the json is successfully exported to a file
and a test in which there is no dictionary for that language.
